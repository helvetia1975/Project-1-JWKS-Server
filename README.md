# Project-1-JWKS-Server

This set of files creates JWTS on HTTPS port 8080 using RSA key pairs. Public keys are served on a JWKS endpoint on the server, checking to make sure the keys are good i.e. not expired. 

I had a bit of a rough time figuring out how to run a server but eventually figured it out, although the output is not what is expected of the program. I was able to at least create some tests but I could not run any tests, as I could not figure out how to, unfortunately.
